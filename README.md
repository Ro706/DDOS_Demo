## what is DDos attack?
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a type of cyber-attack in which an attacker attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. This is usually done by sending a large amount of traffic to the targeted system, exceeding its capacity, and as a result, causing it to slow down or even crash.

In a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, the traffic comes from multiple sources, making it difficult to block the traffic and protect the system.

DDoS attacks are often used as a form of extortion, where the attacker demands money in exchange for stopping the attack.
